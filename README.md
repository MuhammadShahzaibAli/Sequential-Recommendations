# Sequential-Recommendations
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It leverages user ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations for a group of users. The system calculates similarity between users, predicts ratings for unwatched movies, and aggregates recommendations using different methods like average aggregation and least misery aggregation. The project also includes a sequential group recommendation algorithm that suggests movies iteratively based on user satisfaction. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as pandas and numpy. The project is aimed at providing an efficient and customizable movie recommendation solution for various user groups.
